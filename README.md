# ecomodel-thesis
Code and documentation for my fourth year undergraduate thesis. The model is run in Netlogo, and analysis is done in Python. 
This project contributes to a deeper understanding of habitat patch dynamics and their implications for biodiversity conservation. By managing generalist populations and stabilizing their variability, we can better protect specialist species and promote overall ecosystem resilience.
